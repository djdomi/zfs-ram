# zfs-ram
Use RAM for ZFS LOG and CACHE (insecure, it uses ZRAM!)
Its been used for speed up the things in case, you dont have an SSD avaible, 
be ensure that you have _*really spare ram memory left over*_ 

remind 
its 
really 
insecure 

and 
should 
only 

be used on a Laptop or battery buffered computer which it's battery isnt empty :)

If you have 32GB of ram and only use the half you can use for sure at least 8-12GB of this fast buffer i.e. 40% for write and 60% for read - how your need's are....


howto:
just download the complete zip/git and run install.sh
